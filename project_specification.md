# Project Specification
## what data structures and algorithms will you be using?
Primitive datastructures such as string, array, or dictionary. The algorithm is undecided, but should be for a better optimization of the code speed.
## What problem are you solving and why did you chose these specific data structures and algorithms?
the problem I am trying solving is that given a file, the code should be able to output a translated file encrypted in Morse code, if the input is in plain text; Or it should be able to output the decrypted file, if the original one is encrypted in Morse code. The code has no prior knowledge about whether the file is encrpyted or not. Neither does the code know where are the breaks between characters. The language of the file should be fixed (in English). The code should be case-insensitive and tolerate grammatical changes of the same word. A dictionary containing the mapping of English words is needed. 
## what is the program input and how will it be used?
The program input can be some files, encrypted and decrypted. Files containing the English words and the stop words should also be found online.
## Expected time and space complexities of the program?
the space complexity should be O(n), but the time complexity is undetermined, presumably O(2^n).
## Degree programme?
Bachelor's programme in Science.
## documentation language?
In English.
